    I am a third year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at George Mason University (GMU). I work as a Graduate Research Assistant at the Design Computing and Extended Reality (DCXR) Group, advised by [Prof. Lap-Fai Yu][yu]. Before joining GMU, I received my MCS degree in Computer Science at the University of Virginia, and BS degree in Computer Science at Beijing Institute of Technology.
    
    My research interests are on integrating integrating computer vision/graphics and AI techniques into VR/AR applications.
