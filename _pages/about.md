I work as a Graduate Research Assistant at the Design Computing and Extended Reality Group, advised by [Prof. Lap-Fai Yu](https://craigyuyu.github.io/home/index.html). Before that, I received my MS degree in Computer Science at the University of Virginia, and BS degree in Computer Science at Beijing Institute of Technology.
    
My research interests include graphics, mixed reality, vision, human-computer interaction, and computational design. Specifically, I study generative social activity and human behavior/motion, and scene-aware AR/VR.
