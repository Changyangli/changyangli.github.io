			<h4>Abstract</h4>
	       <p>
			In this paper, we present an approach to perform 3D human body
			labelling and segmentation jointly. Given a 3D mesh of scanned
			human body with texture, our approach segments it into 5 parts:
			head, torso, arms, legs and feet automatically. We assume that the
			faces on the same part of human body share similar color features
			and are constrained by geometry. According to this assumption, we
			formulate the labelling and segmentation of 3D Mesh as an energy
			function optimization problem. In this energy function, a data term
			models the color information and a smooth term models the geometry constraint. 
			Then a GraphCut algorithm is applied to solve the optimization problem. 
			The experiment results show good performance of our method.
